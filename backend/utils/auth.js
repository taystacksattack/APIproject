// This first function is setting the JWT cookie after a user is logged in or signed up. It takes in the response and the session user and generates a JWT using the imported secret. It is set to expire in however many seconds you set on the JWT_EXPIRES_IN key in the .env file. The payload of the JWT will be the user's id, username, and email attributes. Do NOT add the user's hashedPassword attribute to the payload. After the JWT is created, it's set to an HTTP-only cookie on the response as a token cookie.


// Sends a JWT Cookie
const setTokenCookie = (res, user) => {
    // Create the token.
    const safeUser = {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      username: user.username,
    };
    const token = jwt.sign(
      { data: safeUser },
      secret,
      { expiresIn: parseInt(expiresIn) } // 604,800 seconds = 1 week
    );

    const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

    // Set the token cookie
    res.cookie('token', token, {
      maxAge: expiresIn * 1000, // maxAge in milliseconds
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: isProduction,
      sameSite: isProduction && "Lax"
    });

    return token;
  };



// Certain authenticated routes will require the identity of the current session user. You will create and utilize a middleware function called restoreUser that will restore the session user based on the contents of the JWT cookie.

// Create a middleware function that will verify and parse the JWT's payload and search the database for a User with the id in the payload. The default scope on the User model, however, prevents the hashedPassword, email, createdAt, and updatedAt attributes from returning from that search. You want to include the email, createdAt, and updatedAt attributes to be returned in the search (but not hashedPassword).

// If there is a User found in the search, then save the user to a key of user onto the Request (req.user). If there is an error verifying the JWT or a Usercannot be found with the id in the JWT payload, then clear the token cookie from the response and set req.user to null.

const restoreUser = (req, res, next) => {
    // token parsed from cookies
    const { token } = req.cookies;
    req.user = null;

    return jwt.verify(token, secret, null, async (err, jwtPayload) => {
      if (err) {
        return next();
      }

      try {
        const { id } = jwtPayload.data;
        req.user = await User.findByPk(id, {
          attributes: {
            include: ['email', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt']
          }
        });
      } catch (e) {
        res.clearCookie('token');
        return next();
      }

      if (!req.user) res.clearCookie('token');

      return next();
    });
  };



// The last authentication middleware to add is for requiring a session user to be authenticated before accessing a route.

// Create an Express middleware called requireAuth. Define this middleware as an array with the restoreUser middleware function you just created as the first element in the array. This will ensure that if a valid JWT cookie exists, the session user will be loaded into the req.user attribute. The second middleware will check req.user and will go to the next middleware if there is a session user present there. If there is no session user, then an error will be created and passed along to the error-handling middlewares.



// If there is no current user, return an error
const requireAuth = function (req, _res, next) {
    if (req.user) return next();

    const err = new Error('Authentication required');
    err.title = 'Authentication required';
    err.errors = { message: 'Authentication required' };
    err.status = 401;
    return next(err);
  }
  
  module.exports = { setTokenCookie, restoreUser, requireAuth };
